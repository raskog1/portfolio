          I am a Front-end Web Developer with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Art from
          the University of Wisconsin. I also bring graduate training with focus
          in animation and visual effects. I am combining my strengths in art
          and development to create visually impactful websites. My bootcamp
          experience at UC Davis provided me with a Certificate in Full-Stack
          Web Development, along with the opportunity to collaborate on projects
          with other students, mentor, problem solve on the fly, and immerse
          myself in the web design experience. I aim to bring an artistic eye
          with an underlying understanding of code and development to bring to
          life high-quality web experiences.
