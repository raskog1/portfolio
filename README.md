# Ryan Skog Professional Web Development Portfolio

## Usage
This is my professional portfolio that is in the early stages of development.  Over time, I will be adding class activities, and personal projects that I feel reflect my level of skill and knowledge with various programs.

My portfolio is fully responsive and can be viewed on just about any mobile device.

## Future Improvements
I plan to integrate more Bootstrap styling elements, as well as JavaScript to make the website more interactive.

## Programs Used in Development
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap 4
